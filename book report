        <p>The story is about Draupadi’s life throughout Mahabharat. Starting from her very birth from fire, who grows up in a world dominated by men. Her life is intertwined with the fates of the Pandavas, her five husbands and the Kauravas, their cousins and rivals. Throughout the story we understand Draupadi’s childhood life which she spent mostly inside her father’s palace, and how the only people she could talk freely to were her brother Dhrishtadyumna, Dhai ma and Krishna. We also see her journey from her birth, her complex marriage, the trials of the Pandavas, the construction of the beautiful and magnificent palace of Illusions called “Indra Prastha”, and ultimately, the great war of Kurukshetra. In the story we are also told the life struggles and difficulties of Draupadi and her husbands throughout their lives before and after the great war.</p>
